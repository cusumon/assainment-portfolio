            <p>Deciding whether or not to pursue a career in web development is a personal decision that depends on your
                unique
                interests and circumstances. Keep in mind that building up a foundation of strong coding and
                problem-solving
                skills will likely take sustained time and effort. Like many other careers in the tech sector, web
                development
                can involve continual learning.</p>

                    <h1>Vissions</h1>
                    <p>Many people use a vision and mission statement interchangeably, however I see a difference. Most
                        notablya vision is about your future and who you want to be, whilst the mission statement
                        focuses on today and what you do through your actions andbehaviours.</p>

                    <p>So, friends step back and think, that is the intellect. And when you have an intellect, you can
                        control your mind. And when you control your mind, you control your life so set your goals.</p>
