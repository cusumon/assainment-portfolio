            <p>Deciding whether or not to pursue a career in web development is a personal decision that depends on your
                unique
                interests and circumstances. Keep in mind that building up a foundation of strong coding and
                problem-solving
                skills will likely take sustained time and effort. Like many other careers in the tech sector, web
                development
                can involve continual learning.</p>

                    <p>Einstein said you cannot solve your problems with the same thinking that created them. You have

                        change

                    <h1>Vissions</h1>
                    <p>Many people use a vision and mission statement interchangeably, however I see a difference. Most
                        notably
                        a vision is about your future and who you want to be, whilst the mission statement focuses on
                        today
                        and what you do through your actions and behaviours.</p>

                    <p>So, friends step back and think, that is the intellect. And when you have an intellect, you can
                        control
                        your mind. And when you control your mind, you control your life so set your goals.</p>
